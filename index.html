                <br>
                During my time at Sky UK, I took the initiative to propose and lead the Autosmart project. 
                The project's objective was to develop a program capable of running AdSmart stream tests and 
                automating key procedures to streamline the testing process and improve overall efficiency.
                <br>
                My primary focus was automating four crucial procedures that formed the backbone of AdSmart testing. 
                This involved creating a program that could efficiently play out specific streams, execute remote 
                control commands, extract AdSmart reports from the box, and verify the accuracy of the recorded 
                information in the HTML report. The program's ability to provide a pass-or-fail outcome for each step 
                allowed us to assess the overall success of the test. Collaborating closely with the Automation Team, 
                I was given the opportunity to integrate Autosmart with their existing framework.
                <br>
                The implementation of Autosmart was success, seamlessly running 24/7 and effectively replacing the 
                need for one manual tester, significantly improving the efficiency of AdSmart testing at Sky UK.
                <br><br>

              <h4>Final Year Project, 2019-20</h4>
              <br>
              <h3>Developing applications for the hospitality industry</h3>
              <p>
                In this project, I conducted research into Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Navigation in hospitality settings, 
                utilising the humanoid robot Pepper developed by SoftBank Robotics. The main focus areas were Interaction and Navigation, 
                both of which were explored in depth. The project's objectives were split into two areas: Interaction and Navigation.
                <br>
                <div class="profile-images">
                  <img src="images/pepper_conference_person.JPG" alt="Pepper at ENTER2020">
                  <img src="images/pepper_conference.jpg" alt="Pepper at Open Day">
                  <img src="images/pepper_restaurant.jpeg" alt="Pepper in Hospitality">
                </div>
                <br>
                For the Interaction aspect, I developed applications for Pepper to function in a customer service role by incorporating 
                conversational capabilities and tablet functionality. This involved implementing prompted question-and-answer interactions, 
                branching conversation trees, and autonomous animations to enhance anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the developed 
                functionalities, I deployed Pepper at various events, including the ENTER2020 International eTourism Conference, 
                an Open Day for the University of Surrey's Centre for Vision, Speech, and Signal Processing, and research in a hospitality 
                PhD focused on AI and Robotics in Restaurants.
                <br>
                Challenges arose, particularly in terms of voice recognition and handling complex conversations. Although Pepper's 
                capabilities were limited in this regard, potential future work was identified, such as integrating more advanced chatbot 
                capabilities using web services and machine learning.
                <br><br>

                </div>
                <br>
                During the Navigation experiments, I tested Pepper's ability to safely and efficiently navigate in cluttered and dynamic 
                environments commonly found in hospitality settings. The focus was on mapping, localisation, and path planning, with 
                considerations for environmental variables in the third dimension. I utilised 2D and 3D Simultaneous Localisation and 
                Mapping (SLAM) techniques, combined with 2D path planning, to establish a 2.5D navigation pipeline. All of this was 
                accomplished within the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework.
                <br>
                In the Navigation aspect, I encountered challenges related to localization using Pepper's ground laser sensors, 
                which affected path planning. To address this, I introduced the RTAB-Map algorithm, which produced accurate SLAM using 
                Pepper's RGB and Depth camera data, resulting in successful localisation and path planning stages.
                <br>
                An accelerated video of Pepper path planning in a selection of the restaurant with a selection of the path planners 
                used in this work can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5Sw3S2boxA" target="_blank">here</a>.
                <br>
                The project's overall conclusion was that Pepper demonstrated successful HRI and Navigation capabilities in hospitality 
                environments, utilising the NAOqi and ROS frameworks. Despite the success, there are opportunities for further improvement, 
                which may involve additional software and hardware capabilities for Pepper, requiring investment in time and resources,
                which unfortunately was not possible during the project's timeframe.
