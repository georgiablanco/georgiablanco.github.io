              <h3>Developing an automation solution for AdSmart testing</h3>
              <img src="images/ADSMART.png" alt="AdSmart" height="200" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
              <p>
                <br>
                During my time at Sky UK, I took the initiative to propose and lead the Autosmart project. 
                The project's objective was to develop a program capable of running AdSmart stream tests and 
                automating key procedures to streamline the testing process and improve overall efficiency.
                <br>
                My primary focus was automating four crucial procedures that formed the backbone of AdSmart testing. 
                This involved creating a program that could efficiently play out specific streams, execute remote 
                control commands, extract AdSmart reports from the box, and verify the accuracy of the recorded 
                information in the HTML report. The program's ability to provide a pass-or-fail outcome for each step 
                allowed us to assess the overall success of the test. Collaborating closely with the Automation Team, 
                I was given the opportunity to integrate Autosmart with their existing framework.
                <br>
                The implementation of Autosmart was success, seamlessly running 24/7 and effectively replacing the 
                need for one manual tester, significantly improving the efficiency of AdSmart testing at Sky UK.

              <h4>Final Year Project, 2019-20</h4>
              <h3>Researching and developing applications for HRI and Navigation in the hospitality industry</h3>
              <p>
                In this project, I conducted research into Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Navigation in hospitality settings, 
                utilising the humanoid robot Pepper developed by SoftBank Robotics. The main focus areas were Interaction and Navigation, 
                both of which were explored in depth. The project's objectives were split into two areas: Interaction and Navigation.
                <br>
                <div class="profile-images">
                  <img src="images/pepper_conference_person.JPG" alt="Pepper at ENTER2020">
                  <img src="images/pepper_conference.jpg" alt="Pepper at Open Day">
                  <img src="images/pepper_restaurant.jpeg" alt="Pepper in Hospitality">
                </div>
                <br>
                For the Interaction aspect, I developed applications for Pepper to function in a customer service role by incorporating 
                conversational capabilities and tablet functionality. This involved implementing prompted question-and-answer interactions, 
                branching conversation trees, and autonomous animations to enhance anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the developed 
                functionalities, I deployed Pepper at various events, including the ENTER2020 International eTourism Conference, 
                an Open Day for the University of Surrey's Centre for Vision, Speech, and Signal Processing, and research in a hospitality 
                PhD focused on AI and Robotics in Restaurants.
                <br>
                Challenges arose, particularly in terms of voice recognition and handling complex conversations. Although Pepper's 
                capabilities were limited in this regard, potential future work was identified, such as integrating more advanced chatbot 
                capabilities using web services and machine learning.
                <br><br>

                  <img src="images/octo_2D.png" alt="2D octomap">
                </div>
                <br>
                During the Navigation experiments, I tested Pepper's ability to safely and efficiently navigate in cluttered and dynamic 
                environments commonly found in hospitality settings. The focus was on mapping, localisation, and path planning, with 
                considerations for environmental variables in the third dimension. I utilised 2D and 3D Simultaneous Localisation and 
                Mapping (SLAM) techniques, combined with 2D path planning, to establish a 2.5D navigation pipeline. All of this was 
                accomplished within the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework.
                <br>
                In the Navigation aspect, I encountered challenges related to localisation using Pepper's ground laser sensors, 
                which affected path planning. To address this, I introduced the RTAB-Map algorithm, which produced accurate SLAM using 
                Pepper's RGB and Depth camera data, resulting in successful localisation and path planning stages.
                <br>
                An accelerated video of Pepper path planning in a selection of the restaurant with a selection of the path planners 
                used in this work can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5Sw3S2boxA" target="_blank">here</a>.
                <br>
                The project's overall conclusion was that Pepper demonstrated successful HRI and Navigation capabilities in hospitality 
                environments, utilising the NAOqi and ROS frameworks. Despite the success, there are opportunities for further improvement, 
                which may involve additional software and hardware capabilities for Pepper, requiring investment in time and resources,
                which unfortunately was not possible during the project's timeframe.

                My first independent project was developing a of a Grasp Evaluation Framework for a 5-finger, 20 DOF hand with
                tactile fingertip sensors. The GEF consisted of 3 modules:
                <br>
                <b>Grasp Execution Module:</b> this module took a pregrasp and grasp poses and understanding of the workspace constraints to
                execute a grasp using MoveIt! and the tactile sensors to detect a successful grasp at a certain threshold.
                <br>
                <b>Grasp Stability Module:</b> this module then took the pregrasp and grasp poses and the object information to use the tactile 
                sensors to determine the stability of the grasp using metrics. The literature used for this implementation:

                <br>
                <b>Grasp Readjustment Module:</b> this module took the grasp stability evaluation metrics outputted by the Grasp Stability Module
                and the object information to decide whether the grasp needed to be readjusted.

                The project I am most passionate about is when I took leadership in a company-wide product development roadmap.
                This work stemmed from my initial role in the company as a QA and software engineer, where I was developing the 
                test infrastructure, manual and automated, involving designing and implementing comprehensive testing frameworks to assess the 
                software's performance. Through thorough testing and analysis, I was able to identify and address defects, contributing 
                significantly to the overall improvement of our products' quality. 
                <br>
                As the lead of the software development team that focused on "productisation", I designed and managed the roadmap to stable and bug-free 
                software for each product. To establish the requirements and ensuring a well-defined plan to achieve the goal, I facilitated open communication 
                between the software, hardware and customer support teams plus other stakeholders - this was the key to driving progress and fostering 
                collaboration to ensure success.

                Recently, I acquired two faulty Roboquads, which I am in the process of repurposing. I will be working with a friend to 
                develop a new control system for the robots, which will involve replacing some of the existing hardware with new components
                and reprogramming the robot to be coontrolled potentially via ROS.
